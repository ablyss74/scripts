# Small little hack to get jamin running on Clear Linux with little damage.

# Require jackd to be running

# Download jamin_clear_linux.tar.gz and tar xvf jamin_clear_linux.tar.gz

# Drage amd drp[ the ladspa folder to the "move_ladspa_here" folder if it does not already exist. It's a symlink to /usr/local/lib

# Double click the jamin icon or right click and run as program.
